# Paper.js Editor

![](./thumb.jpg)

Vector graphics editor with programmable pen tools aiming to be alternative to de facto standards on graphic design tools.
This tool is built deeply based on [Paper.js](http://paperjs.org). I'd like to take over the phillosophy of [Scriptgrapher].

## Developemnt

```
git clone https://github.com/baku89/paper-editor
cd paper-editor
yarn install
yarn dev
```

## TODO

- [ ] Enable path editing
- [ ] custom shapes
- [ ] Add snapping profile (abstracted method of snapping and smart guides)
- [ ] Key/multitouch/MIDI/OSC assignment on tool parameters
- [ ] Custom hook funcitons for cursor events (grid snapping, perspective grid, smoothening mouse movement)
- [ ] Path constraints like CAD tool
- [ ] Project variables
